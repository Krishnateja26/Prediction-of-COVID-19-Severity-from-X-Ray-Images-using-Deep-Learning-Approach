    <div class="row"> 
        <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2> 
        <p> 
            Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).  
            In 2019, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of a disease outbreak that originated in China. 
        </p>

        <p> 
            The virus is known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The disease it causes is called 
            coronavirus disease 2019 (<abbr title="Coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>). In March 2020, the World Health Organization (<abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.   
        </p> 
        <p> 
            Public health groups, including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<abbr title="Centers for Disease Control">CDC</abbr>) and <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>, are monitoring the <abbr title="Coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic and posting updates on their websites.  
            These groups have also issued recommendations for preventing and treating the virus that causes <abbr title="Coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr>.  
        </p> 
        <br> 
        <h2>Symptoms</h2> 
        <p> 
            Signs and symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. This time after exposure and before having symptoms is called the incubation period. You can still spread <abbr title="Coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> before you have symptoms (presymptomatic transmission). Common signs and symptoms include:
        </p> 
        <ul> 
            <li>Fever</li> 
            <li>Cough</li> 
            <li>Tiredness</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p> 
            Early symptoms of <abbr title="Coronavirus disease">COVID-19</abbr> may include a loss of taste or smell. 
        </p> 
        <p>Other symptoms can include:</p> 
        <ul> 
            <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</li> 
            <li>Muscle aches</li> 
            <li>Chills</li> 
            <li>Sore throat</li>

            <li>Diarrhea</li> 
            <li>Rash</li> 
        </ul> 
        <p>This list isn't complete. Children have similar symptoms to adults and generally have mild illness. The severity of COVID-19 symptoms can range from very mild to severe.</p> 
        <p><strong>When to see a doctor</strong></p> 
        <p> 
            If you have COVID-19 signs or symptoms or you've been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19, contact your health care provider right away for medical advice. Your health care provider will likely recommend that you get tested for COVID-19. 
        </p>

        </p> 
        <h2>Prevention</h2>
